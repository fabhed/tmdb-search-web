Let's start by defining the architecture of our application. We will have a frontend built with React and a backend built with Express.js. The backend will be responsible for making requests to the TMDB API and serving the frontend files.

Here are the core files and their purposes:

1. `package.json`: This file will contain the project metadata and dependencies.
2. `server.js`: This is the entry point of our application. It will start the Express server and serve the frontend files.
3. `public/index.html`: This is the main HTML file for our React application.
4. `public/script.js`: This is the main JavaScript file for our React application. It will contain the logic for the search box and autocomplete feature.
5. `public/style.css`: This file will contain the CSS styles for our application.
6. `.env`: This file will contain environment variables, such as the TMDB API key.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

`package.json`
